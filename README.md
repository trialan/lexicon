Translate the Lex Fridman podcast into any language and listen to it on your phone. 

# How to use this
## How to use this
1. Go to the [transcripts archive on Lex's website](https://lexfridman.com/category/transcripts/)
2. Pick a transcript and copy the URL, e.g. "https://lexfridman.com/walter-isaacson-transcript/"
3. Currently the code in translate.py is set to translate to Spanish, just change the request there if you want another language. Find your language code [here](https://www.deepl.com/docs-api/translate-text).
4. Then replace the url variable in podcast.py with your URL and run the script.
5. Finally just transfer the mp3 file to your phone using any sharing mechanism, I like to use AirDrop.

N.B. You'll need API keys from [ElevenLabs](elevenlabs.io) for the voice and [DeepL](deepl.com) for the translation. They both have free tiers.
